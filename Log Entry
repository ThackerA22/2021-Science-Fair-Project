Artistic Collaboration through Augmented Reality began when my teacher and I where brainstorming ideas for augmented reality, my teacher spit out the idea of having a shared reality in an app where you could use camera on your phone and write something, he was calling graffiti using geo mapping where you write something and other people could see what you wrote. This got me thinking about an virutally reality program called Oculus Medium where you created scupltures in virutally reality, so what I wanted to see if I could recreate Oculus Medium through augmented reality. However, as time went by I realized I do not the skill required to create such an app, so what I have decide to do instead is to create an augmented reality app that can place a 3d model and after the user places the 3d model down the user can paint on the 3d model. 

What I had to do first when working on this project was I had to do reseacher for what softwares to use for augmented reality. The most recommended choose was Unity for augmented reality with Arkit, Wikitude, and Vuforia. Comparing the three Vuforia is the best for two major reason because Vuforia first is completely free compared to Wikitude where you can do a forty five free day trail, and Vuforia does ever Arkit can execpt better because Vuforia supports more apple and android phone's than both Wikitude and Arkit. Since I decide to use Unity I download both Wikitude and Vuforia to test which would work better for me. A problem arose when I attempted to download Unity hub to my personal computer I tried many troubleshooting recommendation, yet not a single on help so what my teacher and I decide to do was use a different computer the school loaned to me. Also to this day the problem of installation still has not been fixed by Unity's support team. I know it will be fustraing if you run into the same problem as I did, but hopefully you can fix it the installation problem. After I got the new laptop I was finally able to download Unity now, next was to download both Vuforia and Wikitude to see which would be the asset I would to finish the project with.
