Aiden Thacker,
I have run into an issue with downloading Unity, so now I am trying to download Unity again and download Vuforia, which has shown up in multiply tutorials I’ve been watching. It doesn’t matter how many times I attempt to download Unity the application says installation aborted. Today not much is going to happen, I just going to try to download Unity and Vuforia correctly so I will not have problems later in the line.
