Title: Artistic Collaboration through Augmented Reality

Rationale: My science project use augmented reality to paint on 3d models. I will use Unity to program with Vuforia as an asset in Unity to create the augmented camera for my android phone. The app will be able to select from different 3d models to draw or paint on the models. The importance of this science fair project is that as never been done before. No one has made an augmented reality app that allows the user to paint 3d models in augmented reality.

Engineering Goal: The goal of the Artistic Collaboration through Augmented Reality is to have an app where a user can paint a 3d model in augmented reality. There will be a toolbar within the app and other features for the app to do multiple things.

Producers: After the research is completed one will download Unity Hub from the Unity webpage. After successfully installing in Unity hub one must download Unity and to do download Unity you can either download Unity form Unity hub after you go to install and install Unity or download Unity from the archives in Unity webpage. After downloading Unity create a project for beginning to work on the science fair project. Once the project is created and loaded then Vuforia will need to be download and imported to the Unity project. Once is Vuforia is successfully installed into Unity began working on creating the app. Make a ground plane in the Vuforia then upload a 3d model to the ground plan. After that works then add the toolbars so the user could switch between models, paintbrush, colors, and easers. Finally, add the coding of the painting and colors for the 3d models. Once finished coding the app go to the file in the upper left corner of Unity and click on the file and go to build settings click on build settings. Once on build settings switch platform to android for the android phone. Now go to the android phone and open up settings and go to about device then go to build number and click on it seven times. After that developer options will be unlocked in the android settings then go to the developer options and switch on the USB debugging to allow the ar app to run. After all that finally select the android device, one wishes to use and finally click build and run and then watch the app at work. 

Risk and Safety: With the work being done on a laptop and an android phone, there is no inherent risk.

Data Analysis: Vuforia, which is an asset, has enormous importance for augmented reality   People will be able to tell what assets are used. The assets in Unity that are used in Artistic Collaboration through Augmented Reality are 3d models and Vuforia, plus some other things. Using c# (c sharp) in Unity I will be able to keep a model stationary at one spot will also begin able to increase and decrease the size of the model, and after that, the art tools will be added through c#. However, it will be a fundamental art app with ar, so it will not look as professional as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrate. After the code is finished I will select build settings and click build and run on my android phone and hopefully, with few bugs the app will work on the phone.
